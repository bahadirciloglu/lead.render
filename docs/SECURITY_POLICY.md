## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

### Mission Statement
Lead Discovery API is committed to maintaining the highest standards of security to protect our users' data, ensure system integrity, and maintain trust in our platform.

### Security Objectives
- **Confidentiality**: Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access
- **Integrity**: Ensure data accuracy and consistency
- **Availability**: Maintain system availability and reliability
- **Compliance**: Meet all applicable security standards and regulations

---

## üîê Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- No single point of failure
- Redundant security measures

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Users and systems have minimal necessary access
- Regular access reviews and audits
- Just-in-time access provisioning

### Zero Trust Architecture
- Never trust, always verify
- Continuous authentication and authorization
- Micro-segmentation of network resources

---

## üîë Access Control

### Authentication
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** required for all admin accounts
- **Strong password policies** (minimum 12 characters, complexity requirements)
- **Session management** with automatic timeout
- **JWT tokens** with short expiration times

### Authorization
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**
- **API key management** for external integrations
- **Resource-level permissions**
- **Regular access reviews**

### Access Monitoring
- **Login attempt monitoring**
- **Suspicious activity detection**
- **Access log analysis**
- **Real-time alerts**

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Protection

### Data Classification
- **Public**: Non-sensitive information
- **Internal**: Company internal information
- **Confidential**: Sensitive business information
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive information (PII, financial data)

### Encryption
- **Data at rest**: AES-256 encryption
- **Data in transit**: TLS 1.3 encryption
- **Database encryption**: Full database encryption
- **Key management**: Secure key rotation

### Data Handling
- **Data minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Data retention**: Automatic data deletion policies
- **Data backup**: Encrypted backup storage
- **Data disposal**: Secure data destruction

---

## üåê Network Security

### Network Architecture
- **VPC isolation** for different environments
- **Subnet segmentation** by function
- **Security groups** and network ACLs
- **Load balancer** security

### Firewall Rules
- **Default deny** all traffic
- **Whitelist** necessary services only
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **DDoS protection** enabled

### SSL/TLS Configuration
- **TLS 1.3** preferred
- **Strong cipher suites** only
- **Certificate pinning** for critical services
- **Automatic certificate renewal**

---

## üîí Application Security

### Input Validation
- **Input sanitization** for all user inputs
- **Parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers
- **XSS protection** enabled

### API Security
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **API key validation** for external access
- **Request/response validation**
- **Error handling** without information disclosure

### Code Security
- **Regular security code reviews**
- **Static application security testing (SAST)**
- **Dynamic application security testing (DAST)**
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning**

---

## üö® Incident Response

### Incident Classification
- **Low**: Minor security events
- **Medium**: Security incidents with limited impact
- **High**: Significant security breaches
- **Critical**: Major security incidents

### Response Process
